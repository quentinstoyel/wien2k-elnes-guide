# wien2k-elnes-guide


User guide on how to do calculate ELNES with WIEN2k's TELNES3 module, in particular for lithium's k edge.

The examples and discussion is somewhat personalized for my own situation, but should be useful to anyone attempting similar calculations.

The advice given here is from my own experiences with running WIEN2k and for specific or subtle cases, I refer you to the wien2k forums where there are many helpful people far more knowledgable in this matter than me.
